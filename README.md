# AI_Agent-Automatisation_n8n
Building AI agents and automations in n8n is essential for improving efficiency in enterprise workflows. That’s why I want to share my expertise in these areas with my community. Each automation project addresses a specific business problem and represents a distinct task or use case.

# Job 1 is called Assistant Manager-Email :
🚀 My new AI Agent copilot (built in n8n): from inbox chaos to a smarter calendar—automatically.
Why this matters for Data/AI Engineers: AI Agents are becoming the glue between our tools. Think of it like a lightweight, flexible ops layer—easier to prototype than some traditional stacks (Talend / NiFi / Kafka) for many day-to-day automations.
What this workflow does:
🧹 Cleans the inbox: auto-deletes messages I don’t need
📅 Creates calendar events for emails about meetings or interventions
⏰ Looks ahead 48h for upcoming events and notifies me
✍️ Drafts replies for messages that need an answer and pings me to review
Why I’m excited: it’s fast to build, easy to iterate, and it boosts my execution speed as an AI/Data Engineer.
Thinking of learning AI Agents? Highly recommend.
If you want my n8n template or node settings, drop a “AI Agent” in the comments and I’ll share. 🙌
